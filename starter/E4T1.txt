# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- We can move application instance to private subnet
- Remove allow ingress traffic from the public to port 22
- Disable SSH password authentication
# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
- Adjust the instance role to not allow wildcard access to S3 bucket. Should apply least privileges principal
- S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled. And data in S3 bucket should be encrypted
